## Optimization of Memory Usage

In XiaoMi, some of our clusters experience unreasonably high memory load. To reduce the unknown-where memory cost we introduce "auto-memory-release", thanks to @linlinhaohao888.

Currently this feature is disable by default due to severe performance downgrade during each run of memory release.
