# Release Notes of v1.12.3

The following are the highlights in this release:

## New Hotspot Algorithm Support

A new algorithm of hotspot detection is supported here, which makes the following improvements:

1. It defined the concept of threshold, and ready for automatic monitoring.
2. It has higher stability

Thanks to @Smityz .
